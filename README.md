ZOMBIE TWITTER!

This project is a team effort. The co-conspirators include myself, @Meeeeeesh, and @Kennethjk3. We were tasked with building a Twitter like program for Zombies to use in the terminal.

This commit is a nearly finished beta version, although some minor revisions and additional test files will likely be uploaded. To use our Zwitter program, just unzip the folder on your desktop, navigate to that folder in your terminal, and type in:

    ruby app.rb

To simplify populating Zwitter, a few default profiles, tweets, and relationships have been created. Feel free to log in as one of these, or create your own Zombie profile. Here are the current logins:

    Username: meesh
    Password: tibby

    Username: poe
    Password: secret

    Username: ken
    Password: grains

Enjoy the brains...
