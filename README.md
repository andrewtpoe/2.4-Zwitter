ZOMBIE TWITTER!

This commit is for dev purposes only and the program is not ready to run. It is primarily pushed for my co-conspirators @Meeeeeesh and @Kennethjk3.

I structured the files we made earlier today a little differently so it should be easier to work with and more inline with how the finished program should be structured. All program classes should go in the 'classes' folder, tests in the 'tests' folder.

Calling < ruby app.rb > works exactly the same as before.

Calling < ruby autotest.rb > will load and run the program tests we were working on.
